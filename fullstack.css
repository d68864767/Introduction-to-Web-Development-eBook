/* This file will contain specific styles for the Full-Stack Development page */

/* You can add styles specific to this page. For example, if you want to change the color of h2 in this page only, you can do it like this: */

main h2 {
    color: #333;
}

/* If you want to add some style to the paragraphs in the main content area, you can do it like this: */

main p {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    line-height: 1.8;
}

/* Remember, the styles you define here will only apply to the Full-Stack Development page, as this CSS file is only linked in fullstack.html */
