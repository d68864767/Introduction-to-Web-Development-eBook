# Introduction to Web Development

This project is a comprehensive guide to web development for beginners. It covers a wide range of topics from the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to more advanced topics like front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several HTML pages, each covering a different topic. The main `index.html` serves as the landing page and provides navigation to all other pages. Each page has its own dedicated CSS and JavaScript files for styling and interactivity.

Here is a brief overview of the files in this project:

- `index.html`: The main landing page of the guide.
- `styles.css`: The main CSS file that contains styles used across all pages.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file that contains scripts used across all pages.
- `introduction.html`: A page that provides an introduction to web development.
- `frontend.html`: A page that covers the basics of front-end development.
- `backend.html`: A page that covers the basics of back-end development.
- `fullstack.html`: A page that covers the basics of full-stack development.
- `html_intro.html`: A page that introduces HTML.

- `future_learning.html`: A page that introduces more advanced topics and provides resources for further learning.
- `summary_encouragement.html`: A summary of the guide and some encouraging words for beginners.

Each HTML page has a corresponding CSS and JavaScript file for styling and interactivity. For example, `introduction.html` has `introduction.css` and `introduction.js`.
